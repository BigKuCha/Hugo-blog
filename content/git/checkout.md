In no particular order, here is what we are working on:

Intelligently related posts (#98)
Even easier deployment to S3, SSH, GitHub, rsync. Give the tools section a shot or read one of the related tutorials.
Import from other website systems. There are already existing migration tools but they don’t cover all major platforms.
An interactive web based editor (See https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/web-based-editor/155)
Additional themes (always on-going, contributions welcome!)
Dynamic image resizing via shortcodes (#1014)
Native support for additional content formats (AsciiDoc #1435, reST #1436)
And, last but not least, Your best ideas!
Feel free to contribute or open a new issue if you have an idea for a new feature.)
